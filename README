Comparison of various hash-like data structures, their time and space complexity on different data patterns.

usage: ./test keyLen items <seq1|seq2|random>

keyLen -- used keys length (in bytes)
items -- number of items to insert/lookup
seq1 -- insert numbers 1..items (we skip numbers with zero bytes), store LSB first (= least significant byte (out of 32bit number) is first)
seq2 -- as seq1, but store MSB first (= most significant byte (out of 32bit number) is first)
random -- generate (pseudo)random keys

To build in 32bit mode:
$ make CFLAGS="-m32"
You may need libc6-dev-i386, ia32-libs packages and 32bit versions of libJudy, libproc
